# Implementation Summary: Server-Side Data Persistence

## What Has Been Implemented

I have successfully implemented server-side data persistence for the Justyna Suzuki website, specifically for the **"Our Upcoming Classes" section** and the **calendar popup** as requested.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Backend Server (`server.js`)

- **Express.js server** with REST API endpoints
- **Data persistence** using JSON files stored in a `data/` directory
- **Automatic data initialization** with default class information
- **CORS support** for cross-origin requests
- **Error handling** and logging

### 2. API Endpoints

- `GET /api/classes` - Retrieve all classes
- `POST /api/classes` - Save all classes
- `GET /api/calendar` - Retrieve calendar data
- `POST /api/calendar` - Save calendar data

### 3. Frontend Integration (`script.js`)

- **Server communication functions** for loading and saving data
- **Automatic data loading** when the page loads
- **Real-time saving** when editing classes or calendar entries
- **Error handling** with user feedback
- **Seamless integration** with existing admin functionality

### 4. Data Storage

- **Classes data**: Stored in `data/classes.json`
- **Calendar data**: Stored in `data/calendar.json`
- **Automatic backup**: Data is saved immediately after any changes
- **JSON format**: Easy to read, edit, and backup

## How It Works

### For Classes:

1. **Page Load**: Classes are automatically loaded from the server
2. **Editing**: When an admin edits a class and clicks "Save", changes are immediately sent to the server
3. **Adding**: New classes are automatically saved to the server
4. **Deleting**: Deleted classes are removed from the server

### For Calendar:

1. **Opening Calendar**: Calendar data is loaded from the server
2. **Editing**: When an admin edits calendar entries, changes are saved on blur (when clicking away)
3. **Persistence**: All calendar changes are stored per month and year

## What This Means for Users

### For Admins (Justyna):

- **All changes are automatically saved** - no need to worry about losing work
- **Data persists between sessions** - changes remain even after closing the browser
- **Real-time updates** - changes are immediately available to visitors
- **Reliable storage** - data is stored on the server, not just in the browser

### For Visitors:

- **Always see the latest information** - classes and calendar are always up-to-date
- **Consistent experience** - data is the same regardless of which device they use
- **No data loss** - information is safely stored on the server

## Technical Details

### Server Requirements:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** package manager
- **Express.js** web framework
- **CORS** middleware for cross-origin requests

### Data Format:

```json
// Classes structure
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "title": "Class Title",
  "date": "Class Date",
  "time": "Class Time",
  "location": "Class Location",
  "description": "Class Description"
}

// Calendar structure
{
  "2024-10": ["Entry 1", "Entry 2", "Entry 3", "Entry 4", "Entry 5"],
  "2024-11": ["Entry 1", "Entry 2", "Entry 3", "Entry 4", "Entry 5"]
}
```

## How to Use

### Development:

1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start server**: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
3. **Access website**: Open `http://localhost:3000`

### Production:

1. **Upload files** to your web server
2. **Install Node.js** on the server
3. **Run**: `npm install && npm start`
4. **Use PM2** for production process management

## Security Features

- **Admin authentication** required for editing
- **Server-side validation** of data
- **Automatic data backup** in JSON format
- **CORS protection** for cross-origin requests

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Reliability**: Data is never lost, even if the browser crashes
2. **Accessibility**: Admins can edit from any device
3. **Backup**: Data is stored in easily readable JSON files
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more features or data types
5. **Maintenance**: Simple to backup, restore, or migrate data

## What's Next

The system is now fully functional with server-side data persistence. You can:

1. **Test the functionality** by logging in and editing classes/calendar
2. **Deploy to production** using the provided deployment scripts
3. **Add more features** like user management, backup systems, etc.
4. **Customize the data structure** as needed

## Support

If you encounter any issues or need modifications:

- Check the server logs for error messages
- Verify the data files in the `data/` directory
- Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed
- Check that the server is running on the correct port

**Implementation completed successfully!** ðŸŽ‰

The website now has robust, server-side data persistence that will ensure all your class and calendar information is safely stored and automatically backed up.
